Knead the ingredients into dough.
Shape into a 16 inch log: Using your hands, shape the dough into a 16 inch log. No need to use a rolling pin because this doesn’t need to be perfect.
Cut into 16 strips: Cut the log into 16 1-inch strips.
Roll each strip into an 8-inch rope.
Tie the rope into a knot.
Shape each strip into knots
You can tuck the ends underneath the knot or leave them out– that’s totally up to you.
Let the shaped knots rest for about 30 minutes before brushing with butter and baking.
Right before baking, generously brush the knots with garlic herb butter. Simply combine melted butter, fresh garlic or garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and salt.
Flavor Tip: Save some of the garlic butter to brush onto the knots as they come out of the oven, then top each with fresh parmesan and chopped parsley. The parmesan and parsley are completely optional, but make an awesome garnish.
